    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>
      Hey there! I'm Alexander Dong, but you can call me Alex. (Or don't, it
      doesn't really matter to me.)
    </h2>
    <p>
      There's not too much to know about me (I'm not particularly interesting).
      I have an older sister who's also in SITHS, Irene Dong (who's leagues
      smarter than I am, except in compsci probably), moved from Brooklyn to
      Staten Island in 2015, and my birthday is on August 18th (which is the
      same as Percy Jackson from Percy Jackson and the Olympians by Rick
      Riordan! (Yes, I'm a nerd. Mythology (especially Greek) and Rick Riordan
      is awesome.)) Also, I truly did choose to take Javascript with you because
      you were the teacher, as I've heard how great of a teacher you are (and
      just from these first few days, I can safely say that they were correct).
      As much as I like Dr. Frusci, he babied us through Python, leaving me
      feeling that I didn't really learn all that much (no offense to him
      though! he's an awesome guy), which I didn't want again. I'm sure that
      this class will be challenging, but I am completely up for that, and that
      even one of the reasons why I chose to take this class. Just wanted to let
      you know :] Unfortunately, I don't think this is what you meant by "A
      short paragraph", so hopefully you'll forgive me and not dock off any
      points. Sorry!

    <h3>Wikipedia Article Recommendation!</h3>
    <p>
      If you're ever in the mood to read about even more stuff that (probably)
      won't impact your life in any way, here's my absolute favorite Wikipedia
      article (or more accurately, a collection of articles.)
    </p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Unusual_articles"
      >A wikipedia link that redirects to Wikipedia's official list of Unusual
      Articles! Perfect for if you want to kill some time reading about random
      things.

    <h3>A Handpicked Assortment of Articles From the Link Above:</h3>
    <p>
      A couple of the articles that I think are worth reading if you don't want
      to scroll through the entire list, with the descriptions as written on the
      article.

      A numbered list of people who saw my project and copied a component from
      it (or wanted to):
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Matthew Baskevich : Colored background. Didn't even bother using another
        color, even took using a shade of blue
      </li>
      <li>
        Dylan Jiang : Adding wikipedia links. He didn't use this idea, but I'm
        adding it to this list regardless. At least there's more creativity in
        that, given how much interesting and unique information can be found.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wilson Dong: Also added a background color after seeing mine and thomas'
        colored websites.
